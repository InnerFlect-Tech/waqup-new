## Implementation Steps

### Step 0.1: Technology Stack Research ✅
**Goal**: Validate technology choices and gather best practices

**Tasks**:
- [x] Research React Native + Expo vs Native (iOS Swift/Android Kotlin)
- [x] Review Supabase React Native SDK capabilities
- [x] Research OpenAI TTS API integration patterns
- [x] Review Stripe React Native SDK for mobile payments
- [x] Study scientific foundations (neuroplasticity, procedural memory, autonomic regulation)
- [x] Review App Store and Play Store submission requirements
- [x] Research audio playback best practices for mobile (background audio, interruptions)

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Technology decision document (`docs/02-mobile/01-technology-stack.md`)
- ✅ Scientific references document (`docs/01-core/README.md` → `../../docs/internal/02-scientific-foundations.md`)
- ✅ App store requirements checklist (documented in roadmap)

**Success Criteria**: 
- ✅ Clear understanding of tech stack
- ✅ Scientific backing documented
- ✅ Store requirements understood

**UI Checkpoint**: N/A (research phase)
